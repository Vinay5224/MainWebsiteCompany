                        	<p align="justify">Many of us have stopped performing / observing our age-old and traditional customs and rituals for many reasons. Mainly due to non-availability of pundits and secondly due to very high charges to be paid for their services, such customs, rituals are not being followed. Apart from the above, one more reason is lack of adequate knowledge, both in terms of vedic and aagamic subjects. Even if somebody has the knowledge of both, the service charges for such persons is sky rocketing and unreachable for common man. In today’s world it is very essential to maintain a combination of spiritual knowledge (like vedic, aagamic knowledge) along with maintaining a harmonious balance of material knowledge. Then only it will be possible to suggest remedies which are practically viable, feasible and acceptable bye one and all. Parihaara Sewa Samithi is formed to bridge this gap and achieve this motive. We intend to extend our services in all requirements for general public through astrological services, purohita services (like gruha pravesha, nama karanam, vivaham, vrata, (nomulu) and also all parihaara homa for planets, childless, jobless, houseless, intra family quarrels, court litigations etc… and the remedies related to these problems.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Ever since inception, we have undertaken several programs and have successfully achieved our motive so far and commit ourselves to continue the same trend of serving the public. We promise to conduct more and more programs for social welfare – without attaching any commercial tags, as always . . . </p>

                                 <p align="justify">Dr. Chakrapaani was born at 'Ahobilam' - a small town in Andhra Pradesh, also the birth place of Lord Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy. He hails from a traditional and very orthodox family of priests, whose family profession was 'temple priests' for generations. His forefathers (from fathers' side & from mothers' side) rendered their services as 'temple priests' at Sri Ahobila Mutt. Almighty has blessed him with an exposure to the outside world & technological advancements along with spiritual upliftment. He started learning deep insights of 'Prashna' and 'Nimittha' branches of Astrology at a very tender age of 11 from his great grandfather. He completed BSc (Microbiology) and MBA-Hr at Tirupathi. He also did <strong>MA (Astrology)</strong> at Hyderabad and eventually completed his<strong> PhD in Remedial Astrology</strong> from Banaras Hindu University. He is also TWO times Presidents' Gold Medal Awardee as a meritorious student and for predictions in Astrology. He is honorary life member of 'International Society for Astrological Research' and presented several research papers including "Predictive Vedic Astrology through reverse dating of events" and "Establishing link between Sonology and Astrology". He is honoured with the titles <strong>"Jyotish Aacharya"</strong> and <strong>"Jyotishya Vidhwaan"</strong>.</p>
                                 <p align="justify">He is also highly spiritually inclined. He learnt<strong> "Pancharatra Aagama" </strong>at Veda pathasala in Madhuranthakam, Tamil Nadu. He was also rendering his services as 'Vadhyaar' (teacher) in the same veda pathasala at Madhuranthakam during his stay at Madhuranthakam. He also got rare opportunities to perform kaimkaryam (direct service of God) at various temples including Sri Rangam, Kanchipuram, Tirupathi, Bhadrachalam...etc. to name a few. He worked in various temples in and around Andhra Pradesh (erstwhile unified state), as a temple priest. He has performed, organized and participated in various Yagna / Homa / Havan programs at several places across entire India. He is also very closely associated with several Peethadhipathis, Priests and yagnachaaris of high repute. Owing to the above, he received initiation (upadesam / deeksha) of numerous highly divine, sacred, secret and very powerful mantras. At the same time, he is also an advisory and consultant to various (Indian and International) Astrological institutions. He took an oath to lead the rest of his life in service of God and mankind. His mission of life became 'Protection of Sanathana Dharma' and 'Awareness of Vedic Astrology'</p>
